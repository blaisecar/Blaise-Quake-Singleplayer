THEME / WADs

The theme I want to go for is a sort of gothic clocktower, where you ascend higher and higher and face more and more difficult threats, the tower being located in some sort of city at night. This is inspired from a
location form a video game I am currently working on, which that location in itself was lightly inspired from the Clocktower in Dead Cells as well as Bloodborne. As for the story of the area, it is intended to be the stronghold of a powerful individual who controls the flow of time, residing at the top, while having leigons of minions at the levels below to protect them. Of course I won't be implementing proper plot and characters, and willl have these all replaced with Quake enemies, the story being told purely through the enviroment and level design, the ascension of the level showing how it is indeed a tower. I would also like to have some sort of outside platforms around the tower that you traverse to, to see the skyline and see how big the tower is that you climb.

These are some of the WAD textures that I plan to use, having clock and metal gear themed things as well as church windows and metals fitting of a big scary tower.

Map Analysis

Episode 2, Map 1

The map we played we were collectively not huge fans of. The main idea was going through many corridors in a dark factory-like level in order to progress by getting keycards, then tracking back and using those keycards on corresponding doors. The concept was fun, but the map was far too dark and confusing to really support the idea. The textures were quite samey, and the darkness made it hard to naviagate, and even the usage of the keycards itself confused me. Because of these things, the intended exploration and backtracking can fall flat, because the level layout is so hard to remember and move around in. For me personally, the layout made me feel a bit sick to play with all the turns and weird lighting. The enemies were a little more interesting, with some on cliffs and stuff like that, but I found their placements largely kind of boring too. I think if the lighting was properly rendered for us, like it looks in videos of the map, it would make the keycards and backtracking and enemies more fun and interesting. But in the state that we played it in, we did not find it to be a super fun level, not the best designed. 

ENEMIES

Ranged: ENFORCER

This guy shoots lasers. I wanted the clock tower to be partially futuristic, so I think he works well as a ranged enemy.

Melee: KNIGHT

These are some of the only melee units. They can come out from surprise walls and stuff like that.

Swarmer: ROTTWEILER

Not much here, but a typical swarm creature.

Heavy: DEATH KNIGHT

This guy fits the aesthetic well and can be used as a sort of miniboss.

The Clocktower is, as the name suggests, a tower. It opens with...

ENTRANCE ROOM
Nothinig here but some weapons and some bridges, and a staircase leading to...

FLOOR 1 - Twisting Gear
Basic combat trial. Things will not be terribly hard, as you fight in an open circular room, and make your way to the next level. I think it would be cool if I could have the fighting platform on a turning gear-shaped object, and perhaps make that a design motif in the whole level. 

FLOOR 2 - Clockwork Halls
Things get interesting now. There are now corridors you must traverse, and there will be melee enemies who appear to surprise you. There is also a new gun hidden somehwere with a secret button.

FLOOR 3 - Perilous Chasms
Things continue to get harder. Swarmers now appear, and there are lava pits and traps, and a small bit of platforming. There is a secret key somewhere that can take you to the Terrace, or you can find the basic staircase. There will also be big pits with big chains.

TOWER TERRACE
Tower Terrace is an outside bridge area that surrounds the tower, allowing you to see it from outside. It has you face a few hard creatures in an open patio, then rewards you with armor and an easy passage to the Observatory.

FLOOR 4 - Continued Chasms
Largely more of the same as Floor 3, but you will need to find a key to progress to the Observatory.

OBSERVATORY
Top floor of the tower, has many stained glass windows and a miniboss. After the fight, you make your way to the top of the tower.

ROOF - Moonlit Shrine
This is where you fight the final boss, and win the game if you emerge victorious. 


OVERHEAD GAMEPLAY CONCEPTS

Floor 1 - Twisting Gear

This is a basic first level with not much complexity, as a combative warmup. There are creatures in the center who shoot at you, who will be protected by walls, that will go down once the melee units who rise up from below to attack you are defeated. The map is also rotating (if that is possible to do) which changes where your cover from the ranged creatures is located. Supposed to be a quick but fast paced skirmish. After this encounter, you can go to the next level. 

Tower Terrace

This is an alternative to Floor 4, although maybe I could make it the default floor 4. It's a little confusing at first, but the red door is the secret door in Floor 3 you use to access the terrace. You then run across a bridge with some cover and ranged creatures shooting at you. You then must fight on a platform against 2 hard enemies, which gives you the green key, to progress forward. You then fight some more creatures, and then go across a bridge of staircases and connecting towers. One of these towers can be jumped to from above, which grants the player the rocket launcher, as well as the purple key. The launcher can be used to get back up (more platforms may appear upon getting the launcher as well) and continue onward. After this, the game loops back around to the tower, where you follow a spiral staircase around its perimeter, and are ambushed by creatures who jump out of a window on the way up. Once you get to the purple key door, you can use the purple key and go onwards to the Observatory. If you don't have the purple key, there is a shortcut through the tower that takes you to an alternate vantage point to jump and get the purple key.
