THEME / WADs

The theme I want to go for is a sort of gothic clocktower, where you ascend higher and higher and face more and more difficult threats, the tower being located in some sort of city at night. This is inspired from a
location form a video game I am currently working on, which that location in itself was lightly inspired from the Clocktower in Dead Cells as well as Bloodborne. As for the story of the area, it is intended to be the stronghold of a powerful individual who controls the flow of time, residing at the top, while having leigons of minions at the levels below to protect them. Of course I won't be implementing proper plot and characters, and willl have these all replaced with Quake enemies, the story being told purely through the enviroment and level design, the ascension of the level showing how it is indeed a tower. I would also like to have some sort of outside platforms around the tower that you traverse to, to see the skyline and see how big the tower is that you climb.

These are some of the WAD textures that I plan to use, having clock and metal gear themed things as well as church windows and metals fitting of a big scary tower.

Map Analysis

Episode 2, Map 1

The map we played we were collectively not huge fans of. The main idea was going through many corridors in a dark factory-like level in order to progress by getting keycards, then tracking back and using those keycards on corresponding doors. The concept was fun, but the map was far too dark and confusing to really support the idea. The textures were quite samey, and the darkness made it hard to naviagate, and even the usage of the keycards itself confused me. Because of these things, the intended exploration and backtracking can fall flat, because the level layout is so hard to remember and move around in. For me personally, the layout made me feel a bit sick to play with all the turns and weird lighting. The enemies were a little more interesting, with some on cliffs and stuff like that, but I found their placements largely kind of boring too. I think if the lighting was properly rendered for us, like it looks in videos of the map, it would make the keycards and backtracking and enemies more fun and interesting. But in the state that we played it in, we did not find it to be a super fun level, not the best designed.
